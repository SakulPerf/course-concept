Ionic Pro is a powerful set of services and features built on top of the flagship Ionic Framework that brings a totally new level of app development agility to mobile dev teams.
Ionic Pro has several core services that help you through the full app lifecycle, including
Deploy: Update your app remotely in real-time without app store delays.
View: Test your app with testers and get feedback immediately without complicated device and provisioning profile management.
Package: Build app binaries in the cloud for iOS and Android.
Monitoring: Track runtime errors in production back to your original TypeScript.
Each one of these services is based around a simple git-based workflow that should be familiar to any app developer.

## Install Ionic CLI
* Ionic Pro uses the latest version of the Ionic CLI to interface between your local code and our tools and services. To make sure you’re using the latest CLI, upgrade using the following command:
	```
	npm install -g ionic
	```

## Starting a New App
1. If you are looking to create a brand new App to use with Ionic Pro, you can either start the process in your dashboard or use the CLI locally. If you already have an App you’d like to link, skip this step.

1. To create a new app, run the ionic start command, or follow the official Ionic Framework Getting Started guide.

1. If this is your first time create an App on Pro, you may have to perform some additional steps that the CLI will walk you through such as logging into your account and setting up SSH keys.

1. Once the command finishes, you’ll be prompted to create a new Ionic Pro app or link to an existing one. Go ahead and choose the option you’d like to do.
