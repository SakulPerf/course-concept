# Ionic DevApp

The Ionic DevApp is a free app that makes it easy to run your Ionic app directly on your iOS or Android device.
Skip dealing with frustrating Native SDK installation issues, just run ionic serve -c, open the DevApp, connect to the same network, and the app will automatically load and run your app.
The DevApp comes with many native plugins built right in, so you donâ€™t need to worry about installing plugins.
